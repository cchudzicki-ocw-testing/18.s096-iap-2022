## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

## Prerequisites

Linear Algebra such as [*18.06 Linear Algebra*](https://old.ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) and multivariate calculus such as [*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)

## Course Description

We all know that calculus courses such as [*18.01 Single Variable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) and [*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) are univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as machine learning require the next big step, matrix calculus.

This class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), compute derivatives of important matrix factorizations, and really understand forward and reverse modes of differentiation. We will discuss adjoint methods, custom Jacobian matrix vector products, and how modern automatic differentiation is more computer science than mathematics in that it is neither symbolic nor finite differences. 

## Topics

Here are some of the topics covered:

- Derivatives as linear operators and linear approximation on arbitrary vector spaces: beyond gradients and Jacobians.
- Derivatives of functions with matrix inputs and/or outputs (e.g. matrix inverses and determinants). Kronecker products and matrix "vectorization".
- Derivatives of matrix factorizations (e.g. eigenvalues/SVD) and derivatives with constraints (e.g. orthogonal matrices).
- Multidimensional chain rules, and the signifance of right-to-left ("forward") vs. left-to-right ("reverse") composition. Chain rules on computational graphs (e.g. neural networks).
- Forward- and reverse-mode manual and automatic multivariate differentiation.
- Adjoint methods (vJp/pullback rules) for derivatives of solutions of linear, nonlinear, and differential equations.
- Application to nonlinear root-finding and optimization. Multidimensional Newton and steepest–descent methods.
- Applications in engineering/scientific optimization and machine learning.
- Second derivatives, Hessian matrices, quadratic approximations, and quasi-Newton methods.
