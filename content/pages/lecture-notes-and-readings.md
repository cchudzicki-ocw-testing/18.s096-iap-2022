## Lecture 1

### Lecture Notes

- Part 1: Introduction (PDF)
- Part 2: Derivatives as Linear Operators \[notes not available\]

### Further Readings:

- [matrixcalculus.org](http://www.matrixcalculus.org/) is a fun site to play with derivatives of matrix and vector functions. 
- [The Matrix Cookbook (PDF)](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) has a lot of formulas for these derivatives, but no derivations.
- **Fancier math**: The perspective of derivatives as linear operators is sometimes called a [Fréchet derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative) and you can find lots of very abstract (what I'm calling "fancy") presentations of this online, chock full of weird terminology whose purpose is basically to generalize the concept to weird types of vector spaces. The "little-o notation" o(δx) we're using here for "infinitesimal asymptotics" is closely related to the [asymptotic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) used in computer science, but in computer science people are typically taking the limit as the argument (often called "n") becomes very *large* instead of very small. A fancy name for a row vector is a "covector" or [linear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_form), and the fancy version of the relationship between row and column vectors is the [Riesz representation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_representation_theorem), but until you get to non-Euclidean geometry you may be happier thinking of a row vector as the transpose of a column vector.
